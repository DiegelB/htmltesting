go to /usr/lib/cgi-bin to access the python script for the webserver. 
then on a webpage you type in http://192.168.1.250/cgi-bin/test.py to see the file

first i installed an apache web server to the machine and accessed the file in 
/usr/lib/cgi-bin. i can only run the pyhton files from that directory

you also need to give the right permissions to your pyhton files, as well as the directory
sudo chmod 755 foo.py 

always add the shebang at the top of the python file 
#!/usr/bin/python3

you need to chmod 757 a .txt file in the cgi bin in order to save user 
input from the webpage
